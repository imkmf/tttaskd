# tttaskd

tttaskd is a unfinished GTD app, built with React and Redux. It's intended to be paired with an API server.

This is a fairly large React/Redux application that became pretty exhausting to write. Bummer! Instead of hiding it in Dropbox, I thought I'd share it in case other React developers wanted to see functional code for authorizing with a backend API via JWT, splitting routes via components, etc etc etc

The backend API will be open-sourced soon! If you want to run this locally or use this somewhere, do a `grep`/`ag` search for "UPDATE" - I did my best to find all the various api URLs and keys that need to be filled in.

Thanks to [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) for the boilerplate.
